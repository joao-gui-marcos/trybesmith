## üë®‚Äçüíª What was developed:

-   For this project, I created a medieval items store, in the form of an API, using Typescript.

    I developed all the layers of the application (Models, Services and Controllers) in code and, through this application, it is possible to perform the basic operations that can be done in a given database:
    Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD - Create, Read, Update and Delete).

    I created endpoints to read and write to a database using MySQL.

# Requirements

## 1 - Create an endpoint for product registration

-   The endpoint must be accessible via the path (`/products`);

-   The shipped products must be saved in the table`products`from the database;

-   The endpoint must receive the following structure:

```json
  {
    "name": "Espada longa",
    "amount": "30 pe√ßas de ouro"
  }
```

<details close>
  <summary>Al√©m disso, as seguintes verifica√ß√µes ser√£o feitas:</summary>

  <br>

> üëâ In case the data is sent correctly

> -   **[It will be validated that it is possible to successfully register a product]**
>     -   The result returned to successfully register the product should be as shown below, with a_status http_`201`:
>     ```json
>       {
>         "id": 6,
>         "name": "Espada longa",
>         "amount": "30 pe√ßas de ouro",
>       }
>     ```

</details>

## 2 - Create an endpoint for the product listing

>             "orderId": 1
>           }
>         ]
>         ```
>     </details>

## 3 - Create an endpoint to register users

-   The endpoint must be accessible via the path (`/users`);

-   The information of registered users must be saved in the table`users`from the database;

-   The endpoint must receive the following structure:

```json
{ 
  "username": "MAX",
  "vocation": "swordsman",
  "level": 10,
  "password": "SavingPeople"
}
```

>     }
>     ```

## 4 - Create an endpoint to list all orders

-   The endpoint must be accessible via the path (`/orders`).
-   This route should return all requests and`id`s of the products associated with them.

‚ú®**Tip:**All products are handmade items, therefore unique. That's why it's the products that contain the`id`s of orders.

‚ú®**Tip:**Search the official documentation of**MySQL**about the aggregation function`JSON_ARRAYAGG`, it can be very useful. üáßüá∑

            }
          ]
        ```
    </details>

* * *

## 5 - Create an endpoint for user login

-   The endpoint must be accessible via the path (`/login`).

-   The route must receive the fields`username`e`password`, and these fields must be validated against the database.

-   a token`JWT`must be generated and returned if there is success in the_login_üáßüá∑ in your_payload_must be present_id_e_username_.

-   The endpoint must receive the following structure:

```json
  {
    "username": "string",
    "password": "string"
  }
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è In the configuration of`JWT`do not use environment variables to avoid conflict with the evaluator.**

## 8 - Create an endpoint to register an order

-   The endpoint must be accessible via the path (`/orders`);

-   An order can only be created if the user is logged in and the token`JWT`validated;

-   Submitted orders must be saved in the table`orders`from the database, saving`id`of the person using the application who made that request.

-   the table`products`must also be changed by updating all products with the`id`included in the key`productsIds`of the requisition, and adding in these products the`orderId`of the newly created order;

-   The endpoint must receive the following structure:

```json
  {
    "productsIds": [1, 2]
  }
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è When registering an order, remember to update the respective products in the database, including the created order number in them.**
